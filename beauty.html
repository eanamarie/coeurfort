							<h2> Time to look alive in your morning classes!</h2>
								<p> Whether it’s double tap-worthy #LOTDs or effortlessly pretty 
								#nomakeup looks, looking presentable and instantly photo-ready 
								is a top priority, especially for close-ups. However, the stresses of 
								senior high life—like early-morning classes and late-night study 
								sessions—can eat up most of your time, and doing your makeup 
								can easily fall to the bottom of your to-do list.<br> <br> Fortunately, makeup doesn’t have to be complicated, especially if it’s an everyday look that’s appropriate for school. 
								Here’s how to ace the no-makeup makeup look with flying colors: <br> 1. Start with moisturizer.
								<br> 2. Use Brush on loose powder.  <br> 3. Use cheek tint to add some colors to your features. <br> 4. Highlight your eyes. <br> and lastly
								<br> 5. Wear a light lip stain. </p>

							<h2> How I edit my Instagram Photos</h2>
							<p>Hello everyone!! So the one question i consistently get is
								“how do you edit your ig photos” like a few times a day actually HAHA 
								Basically i edit all my photos with the same filter ( HB2) 
								and similar settings which is sometimes rather annoying as it 
								doesn’t suit all photos. This is because some photos have different
								lighting and backgrounds so the colours come out weird
								in different photos. <br> Personally the number one editing app is VSCO!! 
								There are a shedload of free filters that are all really nice but
								i just use the HB2 filter and then i decrease the brightness by -1 or -2 and i also decrease the saturation by -1
						         so the colour isn't so intense. <br> Like i've already said, this filter and settings won't look good
								 on every single photo so just play around with all the settings and stuff but have fun with it!!<br> Hope this has satisfied all you anons out there hehe thank you for reading !</p>

							<h2> Keeping Fit xx <br>
								Warning: I may or may not be right, I'm not an expert or anything </h2>
									<p>I often get questions on ask.fm asking how I keep fit (?)
									truthfully I’m not very fit. I love sweets and Coffee is my best friend
									but I try my best to keep fit.<br>I wouldn't say I'm generally active but when I have time,
									I swim and I play volleyball and both these sports involve a lot of health benefits.
									<br> So now I'll share to you what some ways I know on how you can stay fit!!<br><br>
									1. You have to stay hydrated ( 8 glasses a day )<br>
										yes that sounds ridiculous 
										and it sounds like a lot but you don’t have to drink it all at once HAHA space it out!! this is super important because it helps your body to burn fat efficiently. And you need this 
										water to replace all the fluid you lose thought the day!! <br>
										2. Sleep <br>
										When you don’t sleep enough, your body produces more 
										cortisol (stress hormone) and this makes you want to eat 
										junk food rather than healthy food, which will most definitely not help you keep fit. 
										You should get around 7-8 hours of sleep every night!<br>
										3. Excercise <br>
										Aim to be active for at least an hour everyday! 
										It doesn’t necessarily have to be running, 
										it could simply be taking the stairs instead of the lift,
										 going on a stroll or cycling
										 Exercising regularly also releases endorphins 
										 which will also boost your mood! 
										 So whenever you’re upset or frustrated go for a 
										 jog or a run!! turn your anger into something good for your body.<br>
										 4. Mat workouts<br>
										So there are a lot of workouts you can do on the mat for 
										various parts of your body!! 
										like arms, abs, legs, butt. 
										Personally I like to focus on my core. 
										If you’re unsure on what to do for mat 
										workouts you can always use YouTube videos to help you !!<br>I usually use Rebecca louise’s videos. 
										She has different workouts 
										and they’re really good and she also 
										has a bunch of motivating videos to keep
										you motivated to keep fit. <br>
										5. Dieting<br>
										Honestly, I hate dieting. I love junk food and my ‘dieting’ 
										is just eating less junk food rather than eating 
										healthily HAHAH. I’m an extremely picky eater and i
										hate most healthy food. which is extremely 
										inconvenient for me 
										especially if I’m trying to keep fit.
										If you’re really serious about your 
										calories and getting into shape, try 
										to change to healthier foods!! You can 
										check the labels of foods to see how m
										uch calories they have!  100 calories 
										per serving size is normal but 400 is 
										way too high so be careful 
										with what you’re putting into you’re body.

							<h2> An Open Letter, from Me to You </h2>
									<p>Think of your body as a landscape, in that way, you'll not be sad about your body.
									 Why? because you don't crtiticise a mountain for being too big, or a valley for being too winding, and no one
									 ever complains about the vastness of the sea. <br><br> You are a part of the earth and  you are so beautiful, sister.</p>
