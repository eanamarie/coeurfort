				<p> Hong Kong Disneyland opened in 2005. 
				It is the city’s largest theme park, 
				but the smallest Disney park in the world.
				Cast members speak English, Cantonese, and 
				Mandarin. Like other Disney parks, they are 
				incredibly friendly and hand out stickers for 
				the kids to collect. You can absolutely spend 
				a full day or even multiple days especially if
				you’re a Disney enthusiast. However, a half-day
				in either the morning or afternoon is worthwhile
				too. The park is relatively small with similar
				rides to the Magic Kingdom, Disneyland Paris, and 
				Disneyland. Fantasy Gardens is where character 
				greetings take place. It’s relatively shaded, 
				and there are nice benches to sit on. Characters 
				appear in pagodas that are spread out through the 
				garden. A photographer is on site to take professional 
				photos for purchase and also will take photos using 
				your camera. <p/></div>

			<div class="Boracay">
				<p> Boracay is the top beach destination in the Philippines
				for vacationers. This small island is probably the only 
				tourist destination in the country where you can find lively 
				nightlife, excellent dining, a wide variety of places to stay, 
				shopping areas, and lots of fun activities, all in one sandy
				stretch. Be forewarned though. Boracay can get heavily touristic.
				If you’re an adventure seeker looking for hidden spots & local e
				xperiences, there are a lot of other places in the country that
				will suit your liking much better. If you do not mind the touristic 
				side of Boracay, then go! It’s a gorgeous island to spend a relaxing 
				and convenient vacation, especially if you’re after the famous
				nightlife. </p> </div>

			<div class="Singapore">
				<p> Universal Studios Singapore is one of the top family 
				attractions in Singapore. Located on Sentosa Island, this theme 
				park features movie-themed rollercoasters, rides and attractions,
				in addition to giving you the chance to meet some of your favorite 
				cartoon movie characters. There are seven different zones to explore
				at the Sentosa Island Universal Studios: Hollywood, Madagascar, 
				Far Far Away, The Lost World, Ancient Egypt, Sci-Fi City and New York. 
				Each zone features its own themed rides, shows, shops, restaurants and 
				street entertainment. If you plan to visit more than three times in a year,
				it is more cost effective to buy a Universal Studios Singapore Annual Pass.
				If you plan to go twice in a 6-month period, you can buy a Universal Studios
				Singapore Season Pass, which also works out a good saving off your USS 
				Singapore ticket price. </p> </div>

			<div class="Palawan">
				<p> This place is gorgeously studded with breath-snatching limestone cliffs
				that cradle swirling mix of aquamarine water and gleaming talcum sand,
				plus jade-colored lagoons that look miles away from the ordinary. 
				Puerto Princesa has beautiful beaches, but it also has hidden gems that 
				we often overlook. Pupunton Waterfalls in Bacungan is one of them. This
				waterfall is newly-discovered, and you’ll find it by walking through a 
				secluded forest. It’s not a hard trek, but be sure to bring your swimming 
				gear with you. You don’t just come here to see the beautiful cascading water, 
				tourists are also allowed to take a dip in the cool natural pools that come
				from the fresh and clean waterfall. If you’ve never experienced bathing under
				a natural waterfall, then make the first time the best time in Pupunton Waterfalls! </p>

			<div class="Indonesia">
				<p> Bali is the most popular island holiday destination in the Indonesian
				archipelago. The island’s home to an ancient culture that's known for its warm
				hospitality. Exotic temples and palaces set against stunning natural backdrops
				are some of its top attractions. Dining in Bali presents endless choices of local
				or far-flung cuisine. After sunset, famous nightspots come to life offering exciting
				clubbing and packed dance floors. Inland, towering volcanoes and pristine jungles greet
				you with plenty to see and do. Most can't stay away from the beach for long, though. 
				Enjoy amazing beach resorts and luxury resorts in any of Bali’s famous areas. These include Kuta
				, Seminyak and Jimbaran where most of the great hotels and villas are right on the beach. They’re 
				also home to most of Bali’s exciting surf spots. </p>

			<div class="Pangasinan">
				<p> Sunflower Maze Farm is located in Tayug, Pangasinan and is said 
				to be the first ever Sunflower Maze in the country. It was owned by 
				Allied Botanical Corporation and was opened to general public in early 
				February but they went on a temporary closure as the plants started to wither 
				and the petals began falling. On top of that, the farm was heavily damaged by 
				the tourists. Weeks after replanting, the Sunflower Farm was re-opened to public 
				on March 25. It was the blooming season for their sunflowers which will only last for a 
				month (petals was expected to fall on the last week of April). So much like the flowers, 
				Sunflower Farm is an attraction that is only seasonal.</p>

			<div class="Korea">
				<p> Changdeokgung Palace is also known as Donggwol, the Eastern Palace,
				because of its location to the east of Gyeongbokgung Palace. For 270 years,
				the palace was home to the Joseon government and was also the favored residence
				of many Joseon Dynasty kings. This makes Changdeokgung Palace the longest-serving
				royal residential palace. Compared to other palaces, Changdeokgung Palace is 
				well-preserved and still has many of its original features. A particular virtue 
				of Changdeokgung Palace is the way its buildings blend into the surrounding landscape.
				The palace's rear garden, Huwon, is considered an excellent example of Korean garden design
				and is the only rear garden of any Korean palace. In 1997, Changdeokgung Palace was added 
				to the UNESCO World Heritage List.  Visitors to Changdeokgung Palace might also like to see
				the nearby Changgyeonggung Palace as well as the recently restored Naeuiwon (Royal infirmary)
				at the entrance to Changdeokgung Palace </p>
