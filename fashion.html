			<h3>A FASHION ENTHUSIAST</h3>
			<h4>I stick to classics.</h4>
			<h5><q>Keeping with it simple and sophisticated style, she always chooses soft, 
			complementary colors that are easy on the eyes. She rarely wears loud prints or bright, clashing styles.
			But that doesn’t mean that she always keeps it safe when it comes to fashion. 
			Sometimes she goes all out as a pretty lady in bold red outfits that are just as beautiful as her name.

				<h3>SUMMER OUTFITS</h3>

				<img src="images/summer2.jpg" class="articleimg" width="300" height="400">
				<p> Well, not so much of a suit as a casual, fun co-ord set. I took a long break from the matchy matchy look even though 
				it’s been trending for a while now, but these days I’m just loving life in top & pant sets.
				My favorite thing about it is how easily you can take it from day to evening, which really makes this
				the thing to be wearing on this way too warm July. Although it’s not super low key, I’m somehow finding myself 
				wearing this outfit whenever I’m having an “off” kind of day and I immediately feel all better and kind of bad ass too, 
				which is really all you can ask of an outfit.</p>

				<h4>FLOWERY OUTFIT WITH HAT</h4>
				<img src="images/flowery.jpg" class="articleimg" width="400" height="400">
				<p> As sunshine is getting more and more intense, a true love and the ultimate 
				solution of bad hair days is now back in my life. I literally spent the entirety of last summer looking for that 
				perfect Panama hat, so much so that I was actually beginning to think I can’t pull it off. 
				Well, I finally won my wish in this cute one I got in Thailand. 
				A lot goes into choosing the perfect hat (It’s a science I tell you!) but when you do, all that hard work pays off. 
				As you can tell, I’m all about good proportions in life. I’ve been wearing that hat with everything! Completely addicted.
				This time around it added that extra touch my all white outfit needed, and together we walked to the sunset on a beautiful April afternoon.</p>

				<h4>Wearing Gym Clothes From the Studio to the Street Look</h4>
				<img src="images/gym.jpg" class="articleimg" width="300" height="400">
				<img src="images/gym3.jpg" class="articleimg" width="400" height="400">
				<p>The Secret to Wearing Gym Clothes From the Studio to the Street
				Look for inspiration in your gym bag. Athleisure expands your choices and is considered seriously chic at the moment. And while hoodies and 
				sweatshirts might seem like they’re for the workout studio, they easily transition to the street. You can even wear the style to work.
				The key is in the combination. Just one accessory or jacket can take your workout gear to the next level. When you want to seem on the go 
				and fashionable at the same time, this is the way to go.</p>

				<h4>LAZY OUTFITS</h4>
				<img src="images/lazy.jpg" class="articleimg" width="300" height="400">
				<p> Get ready to see a whole lot of red, white and blue. We’re betting you’ll also see some stars and stripes since the Fourth of July is 
				almost upon us. While there’s nothing wrong with busting out your Old Navy flag tee and calling it a (holi)day, we’d like to present you with some 
				fashion-forward alternatives.
				Yes, you can actually represent the good Philippines without looking like you wrapped yourself in Old Glory. 
				The key is to pick pieces in patriotic colorways, just in subtler doses. Stripes are also welcome as long as 
				they aren’t accompanied by white stars set against a blue background. The goal is to put together an outfit 
				that marks our nation’s birthday, but you could also rock any other day of the year.</p>

				<h4>STUNNER</h4>

				<p>I rarely wear heels this time of year because lets face it, it takes a special kind of girl to sweat gracefully and although I am special.
				I was missing the height there for a moment so I figured if I can make my outfit as breezy as possible, I just might win the heel challenge.
				I attended my friend's debut.</p>
